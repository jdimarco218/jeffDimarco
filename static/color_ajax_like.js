   This protection is only against a single user pressing buttons as fast

   of which almost 100% bypass the client (browser) (they instead
   directly attack the server). Hence client-side protection is pointless.

   The protection is implemented via Underscore.js' debounce function:

   Using this only requires importing underscore-min.js. underscore-min.map
